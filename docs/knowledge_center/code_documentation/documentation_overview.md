# What is Augoor’s code documentation?

Augoor’s AI generates natural language documentation for your code, bundling it into a single searchable index. This makes it easy for you to explore and understand your code in your own words or by navigating the code itself.

Here’s what you’ll find when you search:

- **Explanation**: A general overview of what the code does.
- **Summary of the code**: A concise summary from start to finish.
- **Step by step of what the code does**: A detailed, technical explanation, almost like pseudo-code.
- **What problem does this code solve**
- **Parameters documentation**: Detailed information about each function’s parameters.
- **Issues it Fixes**: Descriptions of what problems the function solves.


### *Note*

*All generated documentation is in English by default but can also be produced in Spanish. The current language you see is the one selected by your stakeholder. If you need to change or add a language, please contact your internal team to request this adjustment.*

### How to interact with the documentation

Interacting with Augoor’s documentation is straightforward and designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow:

1. Both your code and its AI-generated documentation are part of a single, searchable index. This means you can find exactly what you need without leaving the coding environment.
2. Our AI uses natural language, making the documentation intuitive and easy to grasp.

As you navigate your code, the AI-generated explanations are displayed alongside, offering immediate insights and understanding. This integrated approach means you can access documentation without disrupting your coding flow.

### Preserving existing documentation

We understand how important your existing documentation is. That’s why Augoor doesn’t alter any of it.

Here’s how we handle it:

- Augoor **does not modify** the documentation already present in your code. We display it exactly as you originally inserted it.
- The automatically generated documentation by Augoor's AI is shown in a separate container that overlays the code snippet. This serves as a visual layer, enhancing your understanding of the code while keeping your original documentation intact.

### Why this matters to you

Imagine being able to understand and work with your code more effectively and efficiently:

- Quickly grasp what each part of your code does without needing to dive deep into the actual code.
- With detailed summaries and step-by-step explanations, you get a clear picture of your code’s functionality.
- Understand the issues your code is meant to solve, making it easier to debug and improve.
- Get detailed information on function parameters, aiding in accurate implementation and troubleshooting.

By integrating Augoor’s code documentation, you’ll find that your coding experience becomes smoother, faster, and more productive. You can focus more on writing and improving code, and less on deciphering it. Augoor is here to help you excel in your job by making code documentation effortless and comprehensive.
